HOW TO SETUP
------------

The toolkit makes use of two additional python libraries that have to be 
installed on your system:
 
 * BeautifulSoup: http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
 * Universal Encoding Detector: http://chardet.feedparser.org/

The libraries should be installed in a way that modules "BeautifulSoup" 
and "chardet" can be imported in the code. 


HOW TO USE
----------

Example: 

    $ python scripts/extract_content.py menessentials .../www.menessentials.com/forum

Type "python scripts/extract_content.py" for the list of available options.



HOW TO EXPAND
-------------

To make a new content extractor, create a plugin that defines a subclass of Extractor
and points to it via 'extractor' variable. See plugins/*.py for examples of plugins.
